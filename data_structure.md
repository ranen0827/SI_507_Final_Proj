# Restaurant finder application: Data Organization
## Overview
- The Restaurant Finder Application utilizes a tree data structure to organize and manage the information about restaurants. This hierarchical organization allows for efficient data retrieval and querying, enhancing the user experience by providing an intuitive way to filter and select restaurants based on various criteria.
## Tree structure
- **Root node**: The root of the tree is labeled 'Restaurants', representing the entire dataset of restaurant listings.
- **Cuisine nodes** (First Level):
  - Directly under the root, the tree branches into various cuisine types, such as 'Italian', 'Chinese', 'Japanese', etc.
  - Each of these nodes represents a main category for filtering restaurants, allowing users to quickly narrow down their search based on their preferred cuisine.
- **Price range nodes** (Second Level):
  - Under each cuisine node, there are further subdivisions based on price ranges: '$', '$$', '$$$', '$$$$'.
  - This level allows users to refine their search based on their budget preferences within a selected cuisine.
- **Rating nodes** (Third Level):
  - The next level of the tree can be implemented to categorize restaurants based on ratings, such as '>= 4.5 Stars', '4.0 - 4.5 Stars', and '< 4.0 Stars'.
  - This classification helps users find highly-rated restaurants or explore less-known options.
- **Distance nodes** (Fourth Level):
  - The next subdivision involves distance categories ('<500m', '500-1500m', '>1500m'), representing the restaurant's proximity to a central location like downtown.
- **Leaf nodes**:
  - The final leaves of the tree are the individual restaurants themselves.
  - Each leaf node contains detailed information about a specific restaurant, including its name, rating, price range, distance from downtown, and a link to its Yelp page.
## Usage
- Users start at the root of the tree and select a cuisine type, which leads them to a subset of restaurants under that category.
- They can further refine their search by selecting a price range and a rating.
- The final selection presents them with a list of individual restaurants that meet all their criteria.
## Implementation notes
- The tree structure is implemented programmatically using nested data structures in Python.
- Each node in the tree is designed to be an object with properties that correspond to the node's category and a list of child nodes.
## Conclusion
This tree structure provides a clear and systematic way to organize restaurant data. It enhances the application's functionality by allowing users to make precise selections and receive tailored results, thereby improving the overall user experience.
