# README for Restaurant Finder Flask Application
## Name: Shushun Ren, UM-ID: 24284779
This is the folder for the final project of SI 507 (Fall 2023) course

## Overview
This Flask application helps users find restaurants based on cuisine, price range, rating, and distance from a specified location. It uses a tree data structure to organize and navigate through restaurant data.

## Requirements
### Python Version
- Python 3.x

### Required Python Packages
- Flask
- Json (for loading and handling data)

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone/Download the Repository**: Make sure you have the complete project files, including the Python scripts and the `templates` folder.
2. **Install Dependencies**: If Flask is not installed, run the following command:
```python
pip install Flask
```
3. **Prepare Data**: Ensure you have a JSON file (e.g., `tree.json`) with the restaurant data structured as a tree. The tree should be built according to the specifications of the `TreeNode` class and should categorize restaurants by cuisine, price, rating, and distance.

## Running the Application
1. **Start the Flask Server**: Navigate to the directory containing the `app.py` file in the command line and run the command:
```python

```
